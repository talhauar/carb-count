Energy Flow

This custom shader creates a standard diffuse bump texture with an underlying self illuminated texture that can pan in any UV direction. It also has an cube map with slider reflection amount slider control.

This shader also works well with Unity standard Glow post effect to enhance the energy lighting effect (Glow is Unity Pro Only)


Custom shader properties are:

Main Color – Main Color

Gloss – Amount of gloss

Spec Color – Specular Color

Reflect Power – Amount of reflection map

Base texture (A) Mask – Base texture, transparency controls the energy texture mask

UV Y Speed – Speed of energy texture pan in V (Y axis), center of slider = 0

UV X Speed – Speed of energy texture pan in U (X axis) , center of slider = 0

Energy Color – Color applied to the energy texture (Alpha controls standard glow)

Normal – Normal map to add surface detail

Reflect Cube – Reflection map
